Science has vastly increased our knowledge of AIDS and given us exquisitely accurate tests with which to detect the presence of HIV infection. The wide use of the HIV antibody test not only assures us of a safe blood supply, but enables us to treat patients even before symptoms surface. However, because of the stigma so tenaciously associated with this infection, the HIV test has become a double-edged sword. Cruel discrimination rides on the back of the blade."

30,"20+, HIV+",Magazine,"April 17, 1994",None,"POSITIVE. After we tested positive, we became kleptomaniacs. Traveled across the country, shoplifted $1,500 worth of books from B. Dalton and Waldenbooks and other Kmart-owned chains. As if now that the figure of Death loomed larger, an electronic skeleton in a suit and tie, rattling his scythe over our bed, there was nothing we wanted more than to curl up in a living room chair for the rest of our lives, reading. Instead of letting go, we became acquisitive, stealing all the things we'd never owned: a blender, toaster, coffee grinder, new shoes, black baggy Levis. . . . Ours was a typical American response to the threat of death, the loss of meaning, collapse. Microcosm of America in the 80's? Waste piling up, plastic doohickeys, last week's fashion, useless things and objects and stuff, food byproducts, junk you don't know what it is. Who needs all this stuff, really? We started stealing vitamins instead: megadoses of vitamin C, co-enzyme Q-10, beta-carotene, blue-green algae, every nutritional supplement that somebody somewhere has claimed is helpful for H.I.V. infection. A thousand micrograms of B12 a day, garlic extracts, Chinese herbs, we'll try anything. We've never felt healthier, more energized. We only know we're sick because anonymous lab technicians said it was true, but we're virtually vibrating. You can recognize us by that spirulina glow.

No, it wasn't exactly ""The Living End."" Nice premise -- two attractive, H.I.V.-positive queer boys run amok, rob banks, shoot bigots -- but a truly awful film, and we had no desire to live it out. Tennessee Williams is a little more our style, sultry melodrama with plenty of whisky and broken dishes. I did wind up in jail for a couple of hours in Des Moines, where I grew up, after getting greedy at the Valley West Mall -- I'd never owned a $65 pair of pants in my life, why start now? -- but was bailed out by my brother's band. My boyfriend nervously waited at the Record Den, stuck without transportation among all those white people in some esthetic wasteland. Let me play the role of gay esthete, the horrified queen. . . . Oh, honey, that civilization has got to go. Post-modern homo boys, what a range of styles to choose from. Angry queers were in vogue for a while, but that's over, right? We're dignified now, soldierly, the boys and girls next door. Still, I get testy: I've been promised the end of the world since I was a kid; it's my Christian apocalyptic heritage, and I'm hoping I won't be disappointed. Please, everything burst. NOTHING TO LOSE. Actually, that's a blatant lie. We've probably got years ahead of us without any symptoms, and by that time, so we're told, AIDS will have easily developed into a chronic, manageable disease. More treatments every day. A hopeful new class of drugs, including curcumin, found in the spice turmeric. In the meantime there are alternative therapies, Chinese medicine, acupuncture, psychic surgeons. We put this photographic chemical called DNCB on our skin to stimulate the immune system, leaving splotchy red circles on our bodies. I'm planning to participate in a Santeria ceremony soon, to get possessed by Omo-Olu (also known as Babalu-Aye), god of plagues and their cure, master of time and death. Wear white, head uncovered, the drums thump, thump, thump, a temporary loss of individual consciousness as my body's mounted by a force sweeping through the quivering throng. . . . Snakelike, undulating. . . .

Meanwhile, we're advised to reduce our stress, keep holding on, meditate, creatively visualize healing. H.I.V. infection is in no way, at this point, the same thing as a death sentence. How it functions in our imaginations is a different story. We've been expected to die for so long that we believe it ourselves, and live accordingly. We dream about airplanes crashing, rotting trees, architecture in flames. We want to kiss serpents and explode into fragments in one final, glorious moment.

GENERATION X. Like everything else, we either are or aren't a myth, depending on whose statistics you choose. We're called the ""second wave"" -- young gay men still seroconverting at an impressive rate. Seroconversion: sort of sounds like a weird religious ritual, doesn't it? Are you going to the seroconversion tomorrow night in the basement of the abandoned church? Be sure to wear black. What we lose in peace of mind, we gain in credibility at Act Up meetings. At this point, let's face it, we're the least innocent of ""victims"" -- we have no excuse, the barrage of safe sex information, the free condoms, blah blah blah. . . . Well, rubbers break. (Use two or three.) Maybe oral sex without ejaculation isn't as safe as you thought. Maybe the antibodies take more than six months to show up in your bloodstream, so your negative test is no guarantee. The answer? Celibacy, of course. Masturbation, maybe, but be sure to wear rubber gloves. Fantasy. But we, the second wave, we obviously aren't sublimating very well. Maybe the image of death, a dark, sexy man in black, is something we find exciting. That's death as metaphor, of course, not sickness and putrefaction.

STAR WARS. Our bodies, Jonathan's and mine, are slowly being undermined. His is only 23 years old and covered by a silky golden skin. Maybe you know what it's like to be so in love with a handsome, dying young man because you've seen it on TV. You had to dab the moisture from your eyes with a Kleenex, sniffle, blow your nose. It isn't like that at all. It isn't a cathartic moment of tragedy, a mediated shorthand for grief. Here, in our lives, it is always happening. There are textures, smells, fevers. There are days when we don't even remember that it's there, we're so wrapped up in the real tragedy, which is not in our dying, but in our living: applying for ridiculous jobs, filling out forms, selling books to buy food, stealing vitamins. Shoplifting is hard work; so is applying for food stamps, and every pathetic moron of a boss with a part-time temporary position licking out toilet bowls wants a resume, two interviews, work experience and a college degree. It's really getting us down. We are sad so often.

We lie together in the late afternoon. Jonathan's pale, brown chest, my creamy arms. Other than this, not much is going well. He's even more expendable than I am, because his skin's more brown. 

We aren't members of the General Population. I've never met the General Population, but I assume they're all white heterosexuals with money, who don't shoot speed. Here in my life, I hear it from friends and acquaintances (the non-General Population? the Specific Populations?) all the time: the idea that somebody's already got the cure, that AIDS is a syndrome devised by evil scientists. There's something eugenic in the air, something genocidal. Accusations are thrown about -- that Native Americans are being infected through hepatitis vaccine on reservations, C.I.A. experiments in the 70's, ties to swine fever. Paranoia mutates into new strains as quickly as the virus itself. The simple fact is: we are dying, and this makes a lot of people happy.
I THINK ABOUT DEATH. We've attended these workshops on how to stay healthy with H.I.V., my boyfriend and I, and the main thesis I've come away with is one of preservation. Nothing excessive, no stress, a soothing daily ritual without drugs or coffee or angry pulsing rap music. Just stay cool, and keep existing. In the hope, I suppose, that a cure will be found and we'll be able to go back to our old ways, the tension that is the source of most of our pleasure. So I've been thinking about this a lot. At what point do I want to give it up, burn myself up in a final burst, pursuing some kind of transcendence or ecstasy?

You can choose your model of death, utter blackness, a subtle merging with that oft-posited Oneness of the Universe, the long tunnel and the white light, a fuzzy warm space in between incarnations or maybe a simple Nothing. Whichever model you choose, or if you alternate between several, if you seriously think about death it has to affect your behavior. Exactly how is something I can't quite put my finger on, not even for myself. But the idea makes me feel freer. It may be a cliche, but it's true. I don't believe that the world will end. And if it did? What might be interesting, what might be liberating, is to pretend that it's ending. An excuse to further destroy the environment? We've already reduced ""nature"" and ""the environment"" to a few enclaves, cordoned off, for people who can afford it to visit. How about thinking of the environment as every space we inhabit, right now? Pollution is about degrading this moment as much as it's about degrading the future. At least, imagining that the end had finally come, we'd maybe figure out, when the house is on fire, what we think is worth saving. And what we think should be completely razed.
PROPAGANDA. I get busted shoplifting again, some vitamin C, some E, some garlic extract. The only irritating thing is the self-righteous security guard, convinced that everyone who steals is on drugs. He thinks I'm selling the vitamins on the street to buy heroin or speed.

Afterward we wait for the bus, my lover and I, arms full of information about H.I.V. At the bus stop, a poster educates us about gay-bashings: FOUR TEENS STAB GAY MAN ON VAN NESS. It relates the details of the crime, the man's horror, the escape without punishment by the perpetrators. This is not an education I want for myself or anyone else. Gays as victims, easy targets, pathetic and abused. I don't want heterosexuals to feel sorry for me, I don't want anyone's pity. When I die I want to unleash something into the environment, some sort of energy, an explosion. Of freedom? Revolt? The concept's still kind of abstract, but I'm working on it. Maybe what's needed is a lesson -- to institutions, religions, medical bureaucracy -- How to Die, preferably with a certain sense of style. I want to smash those bus stop posters. If somebody's trying to do me a favor, put up some posters that say: BASHERS ATTEMPT TO BEAT UP GAY MAN. HE SHOOTS THEM. THEY'RE DEAD NOW.
IN RETROSPECT, A BLUR. What am I saying? That we should promote destruction, if not for political reasons, because it's fun? But in the meantime, build a better health care system? Apocalypse is good? Death makes us free? Twentysomethings are poised to wreak havoc on the world? I feel this essay disintegrating, losing its focus. At least in this way, it too can serve as metaphor. For my body? Our culture? So dispersed that only death or apocalypse can give it back a sense of unity? My life, our history, now that it's over, it's clear enough, there always was a point and that was it. To end.

But the world won't end, even though I might like it to, fireworks to amuse me on my deathbed. No, nothing should end, things should multiply, fluctuate, proceed in a sly, continuous mutation. Snakelike, undulating. Shedding the skin when its time is over, just like that."
